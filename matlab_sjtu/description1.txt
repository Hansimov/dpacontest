This version is an improment of the previous one, whcih firstly fix the offset of the mask and mount a traditional first order DPA. There are two aspects improved. Fisrt one is selecting some more effective attack point. The other one is taking the situations that the misalignment between test trace and public trace into consideration. We opt the range of offset to mount a best attack.
