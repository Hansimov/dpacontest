We find that the mask Ox00 always turns up after OxFF (except that the offset is 0). 
And their hammingweight are 0 and 8. So there are a salient fall between them. 
We can retrieve the offset by distinguishing the position of the fall. 
And then we can calculate the hamming weight of the output of the sboxs just like treating simple AES algorithm. 
And since these traces have been aligned, we can choose a few of points to reduce the calculation.
